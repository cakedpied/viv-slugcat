HOW TO INSTALL (steam)

1) extract the artfight_viv folder
2) put the file in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods" folder
3) make sure when you press on the "artfight_viv" folder the first three files are "dressmyslugcat", "modinfo.json" and "thumbnail.png"
4) have the dressmyslugcat mod installed (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2948971756) (https://github.com/MatheusVigaro/DressMySlugcat/releases)
